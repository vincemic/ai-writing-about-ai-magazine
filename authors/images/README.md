## Usage Instructions

To generate these images:

1. Use an AI image generation tool like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
2. Include "claymation style" or "clay animation character" in prompts
3. Specify the detailed descriptions above for each character
4. Generate at 512x512 or 1024x1024 resolution
5. Save as PNG files with the specified filenames

## Alternative Option

If using placeholder images temporarily, consider using professional avatar generators or stock illustration sites with similar character descriptions until custom claymation images can be created.
